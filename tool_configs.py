# This file should be empty except for comments if your tool package
# has only one tool in it.  If there is more than one, give the subtools
# names in the following "tools" array.

# tools=['tool1','tool2']

# The configuration files themselves go in the templates/Configurator
# directory.  If there is only one tool, the configuration is called
# tool_config.json.  If there is more than one tool, then the .json 
# configuration files should have the name of their corresponding tool

# For the example arraay above, we'd expect to find tool1.json and tool2.json
