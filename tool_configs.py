# This file should be empty except for comments if your tool package
# has only one tool in it.  If there is more than one, give the subtools
# names in array of names stored in the Python "tools" variable
# You could just uncomment the following line and enter the names of
# your tools.

# tools=['tool1','tool2']

# The configuration files themselves are found in the templates/Configurator
# directory.  If there is only one tool, the configuration is called
# "tool_config.json".  If there is more than one tool, then the .json 
# configuration files should have the name of their corresponding tool

# For the example array above, we'd expect to find configuration
# files called "tool1.json" and "tool2.json"
