# Configurator

The Configurator serves as a demonstration tool and provides helper
functions for the NMTK.

It can be used as a skeleton for new tools, and it also demonstrates all
the currently working tool configuration features, as well as basic tool
functions such as status updates and returning result files of different
types.
